To obtain a Marriage Green Card, the couple must prove they have a valid and genuine marriage, not entered into solely for immigration benefits. It is necessary to provide solid evidence that the marriage is legitimate, such as wedding photos, joint bank accounts, utility bills in both names, among other documents."

The marriage-based Green Card is initially valid for 2 years and is conditional, requiring that you maintain a bona fide marriage. After the 2-year validity period of the marriage-based Green Card, it is necessary to apply for the removal of conditions. This process removes the condition to remain married to a US citizen, and you receive a new Green Card valid for 10 years."

Each of these pathways has specific legal requirements that must be met. If you are looking to apply for citizenship through naturalization, Connection USA is here to assist you. To qualify, you must be a Legal Permanent Resident in the country (a Green Card holder) for a specific period of time, which can range from 3 to 5 years. After this period, you can naturalize in the United States and obtain the coveted American Passport, allowing you to enjoy all the benefits of being a citizen of the United States."
